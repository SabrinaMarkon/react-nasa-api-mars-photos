You need to tell Express to listen to all traffic, not just localhost traffic. Change your app.listen line to:
app.listen(3001, "0.0.0.0");

By Default it runs on Port 80, so either you have to use reverse proxy or ip tables as:
 sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3000

In package.json:
"aws-postbuild": "NPM_CONFIG_PROFUCTION=false npm install && npm run build"
NPM_CONFIG_PROFUCTION=false is because the npm intall and npm run build don't happen
in production mode, but it will end up in production afterwards anyway. 
If we want the postbuild command to run on a certain folder (say the frontend is in
a "client" folder instead of root, we would just write --prefit foldername ie. --prefix client)

Add key to package.json after "scripts": {}
  "proxy": "http://localhost:3000",
